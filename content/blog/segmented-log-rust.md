## Prologue: The Log ðŸ“ƒðŸªµ

First, let's clarify what we mean by a "log" in this context. Here, log
refers to an append only ordered collection of records. The records are ordered
by time (as a consequence of being appended to the log).

The log indices denote a notion of time since the records are ordered by time.
They can be even thought of as timestamps, with the convenient property of
being decoupled from actual wall-clock time.

They log indices effectively behave as Lamport clocks[^1].





## Segmented Log ðŸªšðŸªµ
### Introduction
### Original description in the Apache Kafka paper

## A `segmented_log` implementation
### Implementation strategy
### Attempt `#1`: Direct attempt to translate theory
### Attempt `#2`: Generic w.r.t async runtime and storage


## Conclusion

This concludes the implementation.

[^1]: A lamport clock is a logical counter to establish causality between two events. Since it's decoupled from wall-clock time, it used in distributed-systems for ordering events.
