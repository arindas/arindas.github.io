Hello, I am Arindam Das! I am a software engineer based in India in the MLOPs space.

I primarily work with low-latency distributed systems and deep learning
inference at scale. This blog discusses my projects, ideas and
ruminations.

Here's my [resume](https://github.com/arindas/resume/releases/latest/download/arindas-resume.pdf).

Apart from work, I enjoy painting! I work with a variety of media, ranging from graphite to oils and acrylics.
In my art, I mostly pursue realism through portraits and sceneries, with occasional abstract pieces.

You can find most of my paintings and sketches on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arind_das/)

Finally, I am a science-fiction geek! Here are some book recommendations:
